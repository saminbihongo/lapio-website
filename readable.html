    <h1>Static websites: HTML and CSS</h1>
    <p>
        The previous parts of the course covered doing several tasks on the command line,
        and using version control for storing and sharing code. 
        In this part we will use those skills to create simple, static websites. 
        We will start by discussing what static websites actually are, and what they consist of. 
    </p>
    <p>        
        To put it simply, a website is a document published on the Internet. 
        The documents accessed via the Internet are located in servers, which are computers allowing users
        to view them via a browser such as Google Chrome or Firefox. Websites are typically divided into
        two categories: static and dynamic websites. The content of a static website doesnâ€™t change, 
        unless it is explicitly changed on the server. This means that every user always sees the same content. 
        On the contrary, dynamic pages are created at the same time as the browser accesses a site. This course will 
        only handle static websites, which can be created using a markup language called Hypertext Markup Language, or HTML. 
        You may learn more about dynamic websites later on in your studies.
